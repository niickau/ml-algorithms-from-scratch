# ml-algorithms-from-scratch

A collection of implementations of popular machine learning algorithms, utilizing complex data structures, metrics, methods, and incorporating other enhancements.

Primarily envisioned as a training project, this repository will host experiments aimed at enhancing the efficiency of existing algorithms and exploring their various variations. Successful examples may serve as valuable resources for junior data scientists in their work and research.

All algorithms are implemented in Python, utilizing libraries such as numpy, scipy, and autograd. 

### Implemented:
* **[K-nearest neighbors]** *(Simple kNN algorithm, but using a k-dimensional tree data structure inside to speed up nearest neighbor searches)*
